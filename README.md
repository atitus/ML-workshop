# Machine Learning Workshop

## TeachGPT – Connecting Math and Science Learning Activities to AI

with [Don Smith, Guilford College](https://guilfordphysics.com/dasmith/)

### Description

ChatGPT is all the rage. ChatGPT can give you a wonderful list of how ML is used in science, including biology and medicine, astronomy, environmental science, chemistry, and physics. But it doesn’t give you a practical guide. That’s what this workshop is for. We’ll call it TeachGPT -- the math behind ChatGPT and how AI can be used in teaching and learning STEM. In this workshop, participants:  (1) will explore machine learning (ML) algorithms to implement simple examples of text and image classification; (2) will examine ML-related math topics; and (3) will walk through an activity using ML to classify images of galaxies.
